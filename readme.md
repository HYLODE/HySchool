## Congratulations

I'm not sure how you got here, but whatever happened then '_Welcome_'.

We assume that you're here because you are going to start work with our data science team. This **readme.md** file will set-out some pre-requisites, and series of short lessons. Your first task will be to learn how to use GitHub for collaboration.

## Aim

You are going to create your user own user page, and publish that to the HySchool website.

## Pre-requisites

- you should be working from your own computer
- you will need access to [GitHub](https://github.com) including a user account
- you will need the following applications.
    - a text editor. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) because it's free, cross-platform, well supported, and generally works well. But feel free to use any editor you like.
    - a 'git' graphical user application (GUI). You could try [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com). You could also just use the integrated git tools within VS Code.
    - a terminal application (e.g. 'Terminal.app' on Mac OS).



If this is already all new to you then 

- check out Software Carpentry's tutorial [Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (lessons 1-3 will get you started)
- similarly review their tutorial on [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). You will need to run through lessons 1-3 but the 'juice' starts from Lesson 4.


## Lesson plan

1. Set-up `<-- you are here`
2. Install Quarto (our documentation and website system)
3. Write and publish your first page
