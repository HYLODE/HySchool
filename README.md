# EMAP at UCLH

See the accompanying [book](https://hylode.github.io/HySchool/)!

Repository for helper SQL, R & Python code to assist development on EMAP.
There are code snippets stored under `./snippets`.
Code should be separated in folders by topic

There is also a JupyterBook under production at `./book`. The main branch for working on the book is 'book'!. GitHub actions are set-up to automatically update the book and publish it whenever a new commit is pushed to the 'book' branch. The site is hosted from the 'gh-pages', but can be reached at https://hylode.github.io/HySchool/.

Advice on working with JupyterBook is available [here](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

## Conventions
- Use feature branching with your username as prefix, e.g. *steve/oxygen* and create PRs against `dev`
- Once code has matured, as decided by consensus, it will move to `stable`
