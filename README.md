# emap-helper

Repository for helper SQL, R & Python code to assist development on EMAP.

## Conventions
- Code should be separated in folders by topic
- Use feature branching with your username as prefix, e.g. *steve/oxygen* and create PRs against `dev`
- Once code has matured, as decided by consensus, it will move to `stable`
