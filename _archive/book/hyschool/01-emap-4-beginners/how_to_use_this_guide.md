# How to use this guide

Read through the material on the [website](https://hylode.github.io/HySchool/intro.html)

Interactive examples

- Fork the repository `https://github.com/hylode/hyschool.git` 
- then clone or download the forked repo to a UCLH machine.
- then start Jupyter at the top level of the directory
- the notebooks should then just run

That's it for now.
